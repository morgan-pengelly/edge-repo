LIBRARY: 	autoconf
COPYRIGHT:

Autoconf was originally written by David MacKenzie, with help from
François Pinard, Karl Berry, Richard Pixley, Ian Lance Taylor, Roland
McGrath, Noah Friedman, david d zuhn, and many others.

Ben Elliston next took over the maintenance, facing a huge Autoconf
backlog that had been piling up since the departure of David.  Other
maintainers have included Akim Demaille, Jim Meyering, Alexandre
Oliva, and Tom Tromey, with plenty of contributions from Lars J. Aas,
Mo DeJong, Steven G. Johnson, Matthew D. Langston, Pavel Roskin.

Today, the primary maintainers are Paul Eggert and Eric Blake, with
help from Ralf Wildenhues, Stepan Kasal, and Benoit Sigoure.  Many
other people have contributed, as listed in the THANKS file.

The following contributors have warranted legal paper exchanges with
the Free Software Foundation for their contributions to GNU Autoconf.
This list results from searching for AUTOCONF in the file
/gd/gnuorg/copyright.list on the fencepost.gnu.org machine.
